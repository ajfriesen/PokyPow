Just connect your power, reset and power led front panel connector to appropriate pin pairs, power the PokyPow via USB-C or an internal USB2.0 header. 
Now you can turn on/off your PC and check if it is running via Home Assistant.

## Use cases

- Hide your PC in a closet or on a shelf without the need to press the actual button. You can just connect any other button via home assistant
- Setup automation based on time, motion or the moon phase, or whatever you like to power on your PC
- No funky magic packets anymore with flaky wake on LAN (never worked for me)
- No addons with admin access (password) to your Windows PC
- Add voice commands via Home Assistant to Google Assistant
