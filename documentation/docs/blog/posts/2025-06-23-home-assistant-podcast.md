# Joining the Home Assistant Podcast to Talk About PokyPow

Hey nerds 🤓

I reached out to the Home Assistant Podcast a couple of months ago. They were open to recording an episode with me, which is super cool!

We recorded this in May 2025 and discussed my Smart Home journey, as well as PokyPow, of course.

You would not believe how nervous I was. I am not entirely sure why, but I was. Maybe because English is my second language, maybe because potentially a lot of people will see this, and I mess up. But after a couple of minutes with Phil and Rohan, it got a bit better.

I haven't watched or listened to my episode yet, as I feel weird about watching myself 😅. I might need to do it, though, to improve for the next episode. Phil and Rohan were awesome and are open to having me on the show for another time, when there is more progress with PokyPow.

Go ahead and have a listen or watch:

Andrej’s smart home journey and designing PokyPow
Rohan and Phil chat with Andrej, a passionate Home Assistant user with some truly creative automations—from a relationship point system to a cat doorbell! He’s also developing PokyPow, an ESP-based device that lets you control your PC with Home Assistant.

Thanks to the podcast, we also got a few more people on the waitlist on CrowdSupply. Around 40 people signed up after the podcast aired.

We are now above 500 people!
I am starting to wonder how many would actually buy the device later on. 🤔
