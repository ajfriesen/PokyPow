But the WiFi was not good enough for myself with the PCB antennas. I bought a board that has a connector for a external antenna.

After trying again and again I sneezed and lost that teeny tiny 0 Ohm resistor and I stopped the project. It was just not fun anymore.</p> <p>However, people kept asking me about the project which I documented on my blog. I send a couple of them out but I was not in the mood to start the project.</p> <p>After a while I checked how many people signed up because of the PokyPow (back then pc-switch, which is not possible to google!). Turn out, over 100 people did sign up just for that at the time.</p> <p>So I decided I will pay a freelancer to do the work I am bad at and do not like anyway: PCB design. It took a couple of iterations, but I applied for a crowd funding campaign at CrowdSupply and to my surprise they accepted my project!</p> <p>Now I am talking to manufacturers to check pricing.</p> <p>To be continued...</p>"},{"location":"reviews/","title":"Reviews","text":"<p>There are no reviews out there yet.</p> <p>But if you are a creator and have a blog, YouTube channel, Instagram or whatever is hot these days, sign up in the form and I will contact you.</p> Loading\u2026"},{"location":"use-cases/","title":"Use Cases","text":""},{"location":"use-cases/#save-power","title":"Save Power","text":"<p>Have a server running for 24/7?

They were open to recording an episode with me, which is super cool!</p> <p>We recorded this in May 2025 and discussed my Smart Home journey, as well as PokyPow, of course.</p> <p>You would not believe how nervous I was. I am not entirely sure why, but I was. Maybe because English is my second language, maybe because potentially a lot of people will see this, and I mess up. But after a couple of minutes with Phil and Rohan, it got a bit better.</p> <p>I haven't watched or listened to my episode yet, as I feel weird about watching myself \ud83d\ude05. I might need to do it, though, to improve for the next episode. Phil and Rohan were awesome and are open to having me on the show for another time, when there is more progress with PokyPow.</p> <p>Go ahead and have a listen or watch:</p> <p>Andrej\u2019s smart home journey and designing PokyPow Rohan and Phil chat with Andrej, a passionate Home Assistant user with some truly creative automations\u2014from a relationship point system to a cat doorbell!

First, the PokyPow integrates with Home Assistant easily, allowing you to not only power on and off your PC but also check if it is actually running. Second, I will build a child lock in the upcoming version.</p> <p>Then he got interested! His kid was only allowed to game from Friday to Sunday, for an hour a day. The PokyPow would be the perfect use case.</p> <p>With this, he could prohibit turning on the PC from Monday to Thursday while also tracking gaming time. When gaming time is over or soon to be over, you can send a notification and or clean shutdown the PC.
