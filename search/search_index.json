His PC was in a hard to reach place in some cupboard and that is what he needed a solution for. He also did not want to use some Chinese Cloud app.</p> <p>Turns out there was no solution fitting his requirements. So I started to figure out to build that solution.</p>"},{"location":"about/#the-name","title":"The name","text":"<p>First the project was called pc-switch. Yeah, try to google that. Not possible. So CrowdSupply suggested to come up with a better name.</p> <p>After a lot of brainstorming with my girlfriend, friends and ChatGPT I found PokyPow.

But the WiFi was not good enough for myself with the PCB antennas. I bought a board that has a connector for a external antenna. Problem: All these boards need to be soldered in order switch from PCB antenna to external antenna. After trying again and again I sneezed and lost that teeny tiny 0 Ohm resistor and I stopped the project. It was just not fun anymore.</p> <p>However, people kept asking me about the project which I documented on my blog. I send a couple of them out but I was not in the mood to start the project.</p> <p>After a while I checked how many people signed up because of the PokyPow (back then pc-switch, which is not possible to google!). Turn out, over 100 people did sign up just for that at the time.</p> <p>So I decided I will pay a freelancer to do the work I am bad at and do not like anyway: PCB design. It took a couple of iterations, but I applied for a crowd funding campaign at CrowdSupply and to my surprise they accepted my project!</p> <p>Now I am talking to manufacturers to check pricing.</p> <p>To be continued...</p>"},{"location":"use-cases/","title":"Use Cases","text":""},{"location":"use-cases/#save-power","title":"Save Power","text":"<p>Have a server running for 24/7?
